# swift-structural 

This repo includes example protocol implementations for automatic derived
conformances based on the `Structural` protocol. It is meant to accompany the
[Swift evolution proposal][proposal], and should not be depended on as a library.

The codebase is structured in the following modules:

* StructuralCore
* StructuralExamples
* StructuralBenchmarks

## StructuralCore

This module contains definition of the `Structural` protocol, and additional
data types necessary to model the structural representations. 

## StructuralExamples 

We implement a number of protocols, using the `Structural`.

Including protocols inspired by the Swift standard library:

- `CustomEquatable`
- `CustomComparable`
- `CustomHashable`
- `CustomDebugString`
- `EncodeJSON`
- `DecodeJSON`

And also protocols based on the Swift for TensorFlow libraries:

- `Additive`
- `Zero`
- `InplaceAdd`
- `ScaleBy`
- `DefaultInitializable`

Lastly, we also provide examples of hand-written conformances to `Structural`
for the following datatypes:

* enums: ASCII, Color, BinaryTree
* structs: PointN (for N in 1..16)

In the future, those conformances are going to be generated by the compiler.

## StructuralBenchmarks

This module includes benchmarks done using
[swift-benchmark](https://github.com/google/swift-benchmark) framework. 

You can run benchmarks using the following command:

```
$ swift run -c release StructuralBenchmarksMain
```

An example output of the benchmark run can be found in [benchmark.results] file.
